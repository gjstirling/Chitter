### Learnings from project so far  

This is my second attempt at this challenge and this is what I learned: <br>
How to create RESTful routes and why they are used <br>
Extracting responsibilities out of the controller and into the model of the system. This brings a separation of concerns <br>
Developing how the model works depending on the needs of the new feature <br> 

### Still to do 
Create User authentication (login/logout) <br>
Add Delete feature <br>
Add update feature <br>
Add username to user and show underneath post<br>
Add styling <br>
